   system-health-check
   
   # Verify boot security
   sudo sbctl status
   
   # Check encryption status
   sudo cryptsetup status /dev/mapper/sda3_crypt
   ```

2. **Create Recovery Point**
   ```bash
   # Create initial recovery point
   sudo recovery-procedures create "Initial installation"
   ```

3. **Configure Monitoring**
