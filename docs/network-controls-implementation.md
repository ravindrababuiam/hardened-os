# Task 13: Per-Application Network Controls with nftables Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Task 13: "Configure per-application network controls with nftables" for the hardened laptop operating system. This task implements comprehensive per-application network access control using nftables to provide granular network security and prevent unauthorized network access by applications.

## Requirements Addressed

### Requirement 7.2: Per-Application Network Controls
- **Requirement**: WHEN network access is configured THEN nftables rules SHALL implement per-application controls
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive nftables configuration with application-specific rules and SELinux context integration

### Requirement 7.3: Network Access Blocking
- **Requirement**: WHEN network access is disabled for an app THEN all socket operations SHALL be blocked including raw sockets
- **Implementation**: Default DROP policy with application-specific blocking rules and raw socket restrictions

## Implementation Details

### 1. nftables Configuration with Default DROP Policy

#### Base Configuration Structure
```bash
# Main nftables configuration file: /etc/nftables.conf
table inet app_firewall {
    chain input {
        type filter hook input priority filter; policy drop;
        # Essential traffic allowed (loopback, established connections, DNS, SSH)
    }
    
    chain output {
        type filter hook output priority filter; policy drop;
        # Application-specific rules applied here
    }
    
    chain forward {
        type filter hook forward priority filter; policy drop;
        # Forwarding disabled by default
    }
}
```

#### Security Features
- **Default DROP Policy**: All traffic denied by default
- **Established Connection Tracking**: Allow return traffic for established connections
- **Essential Service Access**: DNS, DHCP, NTP allowed for system functionality
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of dropped and blocked connections

### 2. Per-Application Firewall Rules

#### Application Categories and Rules

}
```

### 3. SELinux Context Integration

#### Context to Mark Mapping
```bash
# SELinux context mapping configuration
table inet selinux_app_firewall {
    chain mark_context {
        type filter hook output priority mangle;
        
        # Browser contexts
        meta secctx "system_u:system_r:browser_t:s0" meta mark set 100
        meta secctx "system_u:system_r:mozilla_t:s0" meta mark set 100
        
        # Office contexts
        meta secctx "system_u:system_r:office_t:s0" meta mark set 200
        
        # Media contexts
        meta secctx "system_u:system_r:media_t:s0" meta mark set 300
        
        # Development contexts
        meta secctx "system_u:system_r:dev_t:s0" meta mark set 400
        
        # System contexts
        meta secctx "system_u:system_r:systemd_t:s0" meta mark set 500
    }
}
```

#### Context Synchronization
- **SELinux-nftables Sync Script**: `/usr/local/bin/selinux-nftables-sync`
- **Real-time Context Mapping**: Automatic process context detection
- **Dynamic Rule Application**: Rules applied based on process SELinux context

### 4. Network Control Interface

#### Command-Line Interface
```bash
# Application Network Control Interface: /usr/local/bin/app-network-control

# List all applications and their network status
app-network-control list

# Enable network access for an application
app-network-control enable browser 80,443,8080

# Disable network access for an application
app-network-control disable office

# Set restricted network access
app-network-control restrict dev 22,80,443

# Reload all network rules
app-network-control reload

# Monitor network activity
app-network-control monitor [app]
```

#### Policy Management
- **Policy File**: `/etc/nftables.d/app-policies.conf`
- **Rule Directory**: `/etc/nftables.d/app-rules/`
- **Dynamic Rule Generation**: Automatic nftables rule creation from policies
- **Persistent Configuration**: Rules survive system reboots

#### Policy Format
```bash
# Format: app_name:policy:ports
# Policies: allow, block, restricted
browser:allow:80,443,8080,8443
office:block:none
media:block:none
dev:restricted:22,80,443,9418
system:allow:all
```

### 5. Raw Socket Blocking and Network Isolation

#### Raw Socket Restrictions
- **Non-privileged User Blocking**: Raw socket creation blocked for non-root users
- **Capability-based Control**: CAP_NET_RAW required for raw socket access
- **ICMP Control**: ICMP traffic controlled through nftables rules
- **Protocol Restrictions**: Specific protocol access based on application needs

#### Network Isolation Mechanisms
1. **Process-based Isolation**: SELinux context determines network access
2. **Application-based Blocking**: Complete network isolation for office/media apps
3. **Port-based Restrictions**: Specific port access for different application types
4. **Protocol Filtering**: TCP/UDP/ICMP filtering based on application requirements

### 6. Logging and Monitoring

#### Comprehensive Logging
```bash
# Log prefixes for different types of traffic
log prefix "INPUT DROP: "     # Dropped input traffic
log prefix "OUTPUT DROP: "    # Dropped output traffic
log prefix "OFFICE BLOCKED: " # Office application network attempts
log prefix "MEDIA BLOCKED: "  # Media application network attempts
```

#### Monitoring Service
- **systemd Service**: `app-network-monitor.service`
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live network activity monitoring
- **Log Analysis**: Automatic parsing of network events
- **Alert Generation**: Notifications for suspicious network activity

#### Monitoring Interface
```bash
# Monitor all network activity
app-network-control monitor

# Monitor specific application
app-network-control monitor browser

# View current rules
app-network-control show
```
