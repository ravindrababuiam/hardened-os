### Custom SELinux Domains Implemented

#### 1. Browser Domain (browser_t)
- **Applications:** Firefox, Chrome, Chromium
- **Permissions:** Limited file system access, network access (controlled by nftables)
- **Restrictions:** No system file modification, controlled temporary file access
- **Security:** Confines web browsers to prevent privilege escalation

#### 2. Office Domain (office_t)
- **Applications:** LibreOffice, office suites
- **Permissions:** Document read/write in home directory, temporary file processing
- **Restrictions:** No network access by default, no system file access
- **Security:** Isolates document processing from network and system resources

#### 3. Media Domain (media_t)
- **Applications:** VLC, MPV, media players
- **Permissions:** Read-only media file access, audio/video device access
- **Restrictions:** No file modification, no network access
- **Security:** Prevents media applications from modifying files or accessing network

#### 4. Development Domain (dev_t)
- **Applications:** GCC, Clang, Make, development tools
- **Permissions:** Full development file access, compiler execution
- **Restrictions:** Limited network access, controlled system access
- **Security:** Isolates development activities while allowing necessary operations

## Technical Implementation Details

### SELinux Configuration
- **Mode:** Enforcing (mandatory access control active)
- **Policy Type:** Targeted with custom domain extensions
- **Base Policy:** Debian default targeted policy
- **Custom Modules:** 4 application-specific domains

│   └── Domain transition rules
└── Audit and Monitoring Rules
    ├── AVC denial logging
    ├── Policy change monitoring
    └── Context modification tracking
```

### Security Benefits Achieved

#### Mandatory Access Control
- **Process Confinement:** Applications run in restricted domains
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimal permissions per application type
- **Attack Surface Reduction:** Limited access to system resources
- **Zero-Day Protection:** Unknown vulnerabilities contained within domains

#### Compliance and Auditing
- **Policy Enforcement:** All access attempts logged and auditable
- **Violation Blocking:** Unauthorized operations automatically prevented
- **Forensic Capability:** Detailed audit trail for security analysis
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Meets security framework requirements

## Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 5.1: SELinux Enforcing Mode
✅ **COMPLETE** - SELinux configured in enforcing mode with no permissive domains

### Requirement 5.2: Targeted Policy with Confinement
✅ **COMPLETE** - Targeted policy base with custom application-specific domains

### Requirement 5.3: Policy Violation Logging
✅ **COMPLETE** - Comprehensive audit logging with setroubleshoot integration

## Integration Points

### Previous Tasks Integration
- **Task 6 (Hardened Kernel):** SELinux LSM support enabled in kernel
- **Task 7 (Compiler Hardening):** Complements SELinux with compile-time protections
- **Task 8 (Signed Packages):** Maintains system integrity for SELinux components

### Future Tasks Integration
- **Task 10 (Minimal Services):** SELinux will confine system services
- **Task 12 (Application Sandboxing):** SELinux domains work with bubblewrap sandboxes
- **Task 13 (Network Controls):** SELinux contexts integrate with nftables rules
- **Task 19 (Audit Logging):** SELinux events captured in tamper-evident logs

## Usage Instructions

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Run complete SELinux setup
./scripts/setup-selinux-enforcing.sh

# Reboot system to activate enforcing mode
sudo reboot

# Test configuration after reboot
./scripts/test-selinux-enforcement.sh
```

### Validation and Testing
```bash
# Validate implementation
./scripts/validate-task-9.sh

# Quick configuration check
./scripts/test-selinux-enforcement.sh --quick

# Monitor policy denials
tail -f /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep AVC
```

### Policy Management
```bash
# Create custom policies only
./scripts/setup-selinux-enforcing.sh --policies-only

# Test current configuration
./scripts/setup-selinux-enforcing.sh --test-only

# Analyze policy denials
sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log
```

## Performance Impact

### Expected Overhead
- **CPU:** 3-7% overhead for policy decisions
- **Memory:** 10-50MB for policy storage
- **I/O:** Minimal impact on file operations
- **Network:** Negligible overhead

### Optimization Features
- Access Vector Cache (AVC) for policy decision caching
- Targeted policy (not strict) for reduced complexity
- Efficient policy compilation and loading
- Minimal custom domain complexity

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor denials in real-time
tail -f /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep AVC

# Check process domains
ps -eZ | grep -E "(browser|office|media|dev)"

# Verify file contexts
ls -Z /usr/bin/firefox /usr/bin/libreoffice*
```

### Policy Maintenance
```bash
# Update policy modules
sudo semodule -i updated_policy.pp

# Restore file contexts
sudo restorecon -R /usr/bin

# Check loaded modules
semodule -l | grep -E "(browser|office|media|dev)"
```

## Security Validation

- **Policy Development Framework** for creating and managing custom policies
- **Comprehensive Testing** and validation capabilities
- **Audit Integration** for security monitoring and compliance
