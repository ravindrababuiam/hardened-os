## Security Benefits Achieved

### Network Attack Surface Reduction
- **Default Deny Policy**: All network access denied by default with explicit allow rules
- **Application Isolation**: Applications cannot access unauthorized network resources
- **Protocol Restrictions**: Limited protocol access based on application requirements
- **Port Filtering**: Specific port access controls per application type

### Data Exfiltration Prevention
- **Office Application Isolation**: Complete network blocking prevents document exfiltration
- **Media Application Isolation**: Prevents unauthorized streaming or data transmission
- **Development Tool Controls**: Controlled access prevents code and data exfiltration
- **System Service Protection**: Controlled access for system components

### Malware Communication Blocking
- **Command and Control Prevention**: Blocked applications cannot communicate with C&C servers
- **Lateral Movement Prevention**: Network isolation prevents malware spread between applications
- **Data Harvesting Prevention**: Blocked network access prevents unauthorized data collection
- **Botnet Prevention**: Applications cannot join botnets or participate in distributed attacks

### Raw Socket Security
- **Privilege Escalation Prevention**: Raw socket access restricted to privileged processes
- **ICMP Attack Prevention**: Controlled ICMP traffic prevents ping floods and reconnaissance
- **Protocol Abuse Prevention**: Specific protocol restrictions prevent network abuse
- **Capability-based Control**: CAP_NET_RAW required for raw socket operations
