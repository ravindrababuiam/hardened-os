### Bootloader Signing Process
- **Component Discovery:** Automatically finds bootloader files
- **Multi-Method Signing:** Uses both sbctl and direct signing
- **Verification:** Validates signatures after creation
- **Recovery Support:** Creates signed recovery kernels

### Testing Framework
- **Automated Validation:** 8 automated test functions
- **Manual Procedures:** Documented manual testing steps
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Detailed test reports with recommendations
- **Integration Ready:** Prepares for TPM2 integration testing

## Security Implementation

### Key Hierarchy Compliance
```
Platform Key (PK) - Root of trust
├── Key Exchange Key (KEK) - Intermediate authority  
    └── Database Key (DB) - Operational signing
```

### Boot Chain Verification
```
UEFI Firmware → Shim (signed) → GRUB2 (signed) → Kernel (signed)
```

### Unauthorized Kernel Rejection
- Creates test unsigned kernels for validation
- Documents manual testing procedures
- Provides automated detection of rejection mechanisms

| Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| 1.1 - Custom key verification | sbctl + custom key integration | ✅ Complete |
| 1.2 - User-enrollable keys | Multiple enrollment methods + docs | ✅ Complete |
| 1.3 - Unauthorized rejection | Test framework + validation | ✅ Complete |

## Sub-task Implementation Matrix

| Sub-task | Implementation | Files | Status |
|----------|----------------|-------|---------|
| Install/configure sbctl | setup-secure-boot.sh | Scripts + docs | ✅ Complete |
| Enroll custom keys | Multiple enrollment methods | setup-secure-boot.sh | ✅ Complete |
| Sign bootloader components | Automated signing process | setup-secure-boot.sh | ✅ Complete |
| Test enforcement | Comprehensive test suite | test-secure-boot.sh | ✅ Complete |

## Integration Points
