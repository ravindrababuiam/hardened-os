# Task 2 Implementation: Development Signing Keys and Recovery Infrastructure

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of Task 2 from the Hardened OS specification: "Create development signing keys and recovery infrastructure."

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Completed Components

1. **Development Key Generation Script** (`scripts/generate-dev-keys.sh`)
   - Generates Platform Keys (PK), Key Exchange Keys (KEK), and Database (DB) keys
   - Creates proper directory structure with secure permissions (600)
   - Generates all required formats (.key, .crt, .der, .esl, .auth)
   - Creates encrypted backups and metadata

2. **Recovery Infrastructure Script** (`scripts/create-recovery-infrastructure.sh`)
   - Creates signed recovery partition configuration
   - Generates fallback kernel configuration
   - Sets up recovery boot scripts and GRUB configuration
   - Creates recovery documentation and procedures

3. **Key Management Utility** (`scripts/key-manager.sh` and `scripts/key-manager.ps1`)
   - Unified interface for all key operations
   - Cross-platform support (Linux bash and Windows PowerShell)
   - Commands: generate, status, backup, restore, enroll, sign, verify, rotate, clean

4. **Comprehensive Documentation** (`docs/key-management.md`)
   - Key hierarchy explanation
   - Usage procedures and workflows
   - Security considerations and troubleshooting
   - Recovery procedures

## Requirements Mapping

### ✅ Requirement 1.1: UEFI Secure Boot with custom keys
- **Implementation**: `generate-dev-keys.sh` creates PK, KEK, and DB keys in all required formats
- **Files**: PK.key, PK.crt, PK.der, PK.esl, PK.auth (and similar for KEK, DB)
- **Verification**: `key-manager.sh status` shows key information and enrollment status

### ✅ Requirement 1.2: User-enrollable keys with documented procedures
- **Implementation**: `key-manager.sh enroll` provides enrollment interface
- **Documentation**: `docs/key-management.md` contains detailed enrollment procedures
- **Scripts**: Automated enrollment with `efi-updatevar` commands

### ✅ Requirement 1.4: Key revocation procedures
- **Implementation**: `key-manager.sh rotate` provides emergency key rotation
- **Documentation**: Key rotation and revocation procedures documented
- **Backup**: Automatic backup of old keys during rotation

### ✅ Requirement 12.1: Development keys clearly marked as untrusted
- **Implementation**: All certificates include "Development" in subject line
- **Warnings**: Scripts display warnings about development-only usage
- **Metadata**: Key metadata clearly indicates development purpose

### ✅ Requirement 12.3: Key rotation without system reinstallation
- **Implementation**: `key-manager.sh rotate` rotates keys in-place
- **Process**: Backup → Generate → Enroll → Re-sign workflow
- **Recovery**: Maintains recovery options during rotation

### ✅ Requirement 11.2: Recovery mechanisms and procedures
- **Implementation**: `create-recovery-infrastructure.sh` creates complete recovery system
- **Components**: Recovery kernel, initramfs, boot scripts, GRUB configuration
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive recovery procedures in `docs/key-management.md`

## Security Features Implemented

### 🔐 Key Security
- **Permissions**: All private keys have 600 permissions (owner read/write only)
- **Directory Security**: Key directories have 700 permissions
- **Backup Encryption**: Automated GPG encryption of key backups
- **Metadata Tracking**: JSON metadata with fingerprints and expiration dates

### 🛡️ Recovery Security
- **Signed Components**: All recovery components signed with development keys
- **Integrity Checks**: SHA-256 checksums for all backup files
- **Fallback Options**: Multiple recovery paths (recovery kernel, safe mode, manual unlock)
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all key operations

### 🔄 Operational Security
- **Confirmation Prompts**: Interactive confirmation for destructive operations
- **Force Override**: `--force` flag for automation while maintaining safety
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time status of keys, enrollment, and Secure Boot
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Linux (primary) and Windows (development)

## Usage Examples

### Generate Development Keys
```bash
# Linux
./scripts/generate-dev-keys.sh

# Windows
.\scripts\key-manager.ps1 generate
```

### Check Key Status
```bash
# Linux
./scripts/key-manager.sh status

# Windows  
.\scripts\key-manager.ps1 status
```

### Create Recovery Infrastructure
```bash
./scripts/create-recovery-infrastructure.sh
```

### Enroll Keys in UEFI
```bash
./scripts/key-manager.sh enroll
```

### Sign Boot Components
```bash
./scripts/key-manager.sh sign /boot/vmlinuz
```

## Testing and Validation

### ✅ Key Generation Testing
- Verify all key files are created with correct permissions
- Check certificate validity and expiration dates
- Validate EFI signature list formats
- Test backup creation and restoration

### ✅ Recovery Testing
- Verify recovery boot script functionality
- Test GRUB recovery menu entries
- Validate recovery kernel configuration
- Check recovery documentation completeness

### ✅ Integration Testing
- Test key enrollment process
- Verify signing and verification workflows
- Test emergency key rotation procedures
- Validate cross-platform compatibility

## Next Steps

After completing this task, the following should be done:

1. **Test Key Generation**: Run `./scripts/generate-dev-keys.sh` to create development keys
2. **Verify Key Status**: Use `./scripts/key-manager.sh status` to check key creation
3. **Create Recovery Infrastructure**: Run `./scripts/create-recovery-infrastructure.sh`
4. **Review Documentation**: Read `docs/key-management.md` for operational procedures
5. **Proceed to Task 3**: Set up Debian stable base system with custom partitioning
