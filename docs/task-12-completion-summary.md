- **Network Segmentation**: Controlled network access per application type
- **Resource Isolation**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks

### Attack Surface Reduction
- **Minimal Permissions**: Deny-by-default with explicit permissions only
- **Device Restrictions**: Limited device access based on application needs
- **System Protection**: Read-only system directories prevent tampering
- **Capability Limitations**: Minimal capability sets per application

### Data Protection
- **Personal Data Isolation**: Development tools isolated from personal files
- **Cross-Application Isolation**: Applications cannot access each other's data
- **Temporary Data Isolation**: Isolated temporary directories prevent leakage
- **Media Protection**: Read-only access prevents media file corruption

### Exploit Mitigation
- **Escape Prevention**: Multiple layers of containment validated through testing

## Conclusion

Task 12 has been successfully completed with comprehensive bubblewrap application sandboxing framework implemented across the entire system. All requirements have been met with robust implementations that provide:

2. **Security Boundaries**: Strict filesystem, network, and process isolation
3. **Escape Resistance**: Validated through comprehensive testing framework
4. **Usability**: Seamless desktop integration with minimal performance impact
5. **Flexibility**: Application-specific profiles with appropriate permissions

The implementation establishes a strong security foundation for application execution while maintaining system usability and performance. All applications now run with minimal privileges and strong containment, significantly reducing the attack surface and potential for system compromise.

**Status**: ✅ TASK 12 COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Next Steps**: Ready to proceed to Task 13 (Per-application network controls with nftables) which will build upon this sandboxing foundation to provide granular network access control.
