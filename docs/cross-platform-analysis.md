# Cross-Platform Feature Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the feature parity between Linux and Windows versions of the key management utilities.

## Feature Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Linux (key-manager.sh) | Windows (key-manager.ps1) | Status | Notes |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------------|---------|-------|
| **Key Generation** | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Delegated | Partial | Windows delegates to WSL/Linux |
| **Key Status** | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | Complete | Both show comprehensive status |
| **Backup Creation** | ✅ GPG Encrypted | ⚠️ ZIP Only | Partial | Windows lacks GPG encryption |
| **Backup Restoration** | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | Complete | Both support restore with integrity checks |
| **Key Enrollment** | ✅ Native | ⚠️ Delegated | Partial | Windows delegates to WSL |
| **Component Signing** | ✅ Native | ⚠️ Delegated | Partial | Windows delegates to WSL |
| **Signature Verification** | ✅ Native | ⚠️ Delegated | Partial | Windows delegates to WSL |
| **Key Rotation** | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | Complete | Both support emergency rotation |
| **Cleanup Operations** | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | Complete | Both clean old backups |
| **Secure Boot Status** | ✅ mokutil | ✅ Native | Complete | Windows uses Confirm-SecureBootUEFI |

## Identified Gaps

### 1. Windows GPG Encryption Gap
**Issue**: Windows version creates unencrypted ZIP backups
**Impact**: Reduced security for key backups
**Solution**: Implement GPG4Win integration

### 2. Windows Native Signing Gap  
**Issue**: Windows version delegates signing operations to WSL
**Impact**: Requires WSL installation and setup
**Solution**: Implement native Windows signing with signtool.exe

### 3. Key Generation Dependency
**Issue**: Windows version requires WSL for key generation
**Impact**: Complex setup requirements
**Solution**: Implement OpenSSL for Windows integration

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Document WSL Requirements**: Clearly state WSL dependency for Windows users
2. **Add GPG4Win Support**: Integrate GPG4Win for encrypted backups on Windows
3. **Create Setup Guide**: Provide step-by-step WSL setup instructions

### Future Enhancements
1. **Native Windows Signing**: Implement signtool.exe integration
2. **OpenSSL for Windows**: Add native key generation capability
3. **PowerShell Secure Boot**: Enhance native Windows Secure Boot management

## Current Workarounds

### For Windows Users
```powershell
# Install WSL2 and Ubuntu
wsl --install -d Ubuntu

# Install required tools in WSL
wsl sudo apt update
wsl sudo apt install openssl efitools sbsigntool mokutil

# Use hybrid approach
.\key-manager.ps1 status          # Windows native
wsl ./key-manager.sh generate     # Linux tools via WSL
wsl ./key-manager.sh enroll       # Linux tools via WSL
```

### For Development Environment
```bash
# Linux (full functionality)
./key-manager.sh generate
./key-manager.sh enroll
./key-manager.sh sign /boot/vmlinuz

# Windows (status and backup only)
.\key-manager.ps1 status
.\key-manager.ps1 backup
```

## Testing Matrix

| Test Case | Linux | Windows | WSL Hybrid |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
| Key Generation | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Status Display | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Backup Creation | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Backup Restoration | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Key Enrollment | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Component Signing | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Signature Verification | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides:
- **Full functionality on Linux** for production use
- **Partial functionality on Windows** for development/status monitoring
- **Hybrid WSL approach** for Windows users needing full functionality

This approach is acceptable for the development phase but should be enhanced for broader Windows support in production releases.
