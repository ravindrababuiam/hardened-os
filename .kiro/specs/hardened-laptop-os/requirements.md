# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to build a production-grade, hardened laptop operating system with GrapheneOS-level security philosophy applied to laptop computing. The system will provide comprehensive security hardening including UEFI Secure Boot with custom keys, measured boot with TPM2 integration, full disk encryption, hardened kernel configuration, mandatory access controls, minimal attack surface, application sandboxing, and secure update mechanisms. The target is a single laptop model (modern x86_64 UEFI with TPM2) running Debian stable as the base distribution.

## Threat Model

This system defends against the following adversary classes:

- **Physical Access Adversary**: Attacker with temporary or permanent physical access to the device (theft, Evil Maid attacks, border searches)
- **Remote Network Adversary**: Attacker attempting remote exploitation through network services, applications, or supply chain compromise
- **Malicious Application**: Untrusted software attempting privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or lateral movement
- **Supply Chain Compromise**: Compromised upstream packages, build infrastructure, or signing keys
- **Nation-State Adversary**: Advanced persistent threat with 0-day exploits and sophisticated attack capabilities
- **Insider Threat**: Malicious or compromised user with legitimate system access

The system prioritizes protection against physical access and supply chain attacks while maintaining usability for single-user laptop scenarios.
